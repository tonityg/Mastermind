# Mastermind
### A project based in a school project made with the Godot Engine for Android.
The original goal of this mini final task was to recreate Mastermind in the Python's shell. I made aside this project a game readapted for Android devices using the Godot game engine. It save all your games and you can choose a difficulty. This game don't use color but character like '#' (good number but not good location) and '/' (bad number) and 'o' (good number and good location).
